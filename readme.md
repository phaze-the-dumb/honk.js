# HONK

A parser for some random format I started writing todo lists in, much more user friendly than json

Format:
```
Anything not starting with - is a comment

- My Key: My Value
- My Array 1:
    - Element 1
    - Element 2
    - Element 3

- My Object 1:
    - My Key 1: My Value 1
    - My Key 2: My Value 2
    - My Key 3: My Value 3
```

Quick and lightweight! (-ish)
